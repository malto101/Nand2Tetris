# Building the Hack Computer: An Exciting Journey into Computer Architecture

Welcome to the world of **Nand2Tetris**, where i'll embark on an incredible journey to build a fully functional computer from the ground up. This course, designed to take you from the basics of logic gates to a complete computer architecture, promises an immersive learning experience like no other.

## **Building the Hack Computer**

One of the highlights of the course is constructing the **Hack computer**, a simple 16-bit computer. By the end of the course, you'll have built essential components such as:

- **ROM** (Read-Only Memory): Stores preloaded programs.
- **RAM** (Random Access Memory): Enables dynamic data storage.
- **CPU** (Central Processing Unit): Executes instructions and runs programs.

What’s more exciting? The hardware you create will be capable of running various programs, including **games like Tetris**! The course involves:

1. Writing programs for the Hack computer.
2. Compiling these programs and translating them into machine language.
3. Testing and executing them using the hardware you design.

This hands-on approach ensures you gain practical insights into how software interacts with hardware.

## **Understanding Logic Gates and Hardware Design**

The journey begins with **logic gates**, the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics. You’ll start by exploring:

- The **Nand gate**, the simplest yet most versatile gate, which is the foundation of everything you'll build.
- Designing gates like **AND**, **OR**, and **XOR** using combinational logic derived from the Nand gate.

The course employs a **hardware simulator**, a vital tool for modern hardware engineering. This simulator allows you to design, test, and debug your hardware designs efficiently.

By mastering these foundational concepts, you'll build the confidence needed to tackle more complex systems.

## **Course Structure and Projects**

The course is divided into **six projects**, each incrementally increasing in complexity. Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll achieve:

1. **Elementary Logic Gates**: Start with basic gates like `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR`, eventually combining them into more complex systems.
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Build a central computational unit capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations.
3. **Memory Systems**: Design RAM modules, registers, and a memory hierarchy.
4. **The Hack Computer**: Assemble all components into a fully functional computer capable of running real-world programs.
5. **Assembler Development**: Create an assembler to translate Hack assembly language into machine code.
6. **Advanced Projects**: Explore writing and running programs, including creating a simple operating system.
