# Building a Computer from Scratch: My Nand2Tetris Journey  

Welcome to my blog, where I document my step-by-step journey through the **Nand2Tetris course**! This project takes me from the simplest logic gates to building a fully functional computer and even writing software for it.  

## What to Expect  
In this blog, you'll find:  
- **Logic Design:** My experience designing fundamental components like gates, ALUs, and memory.  
- **Hardware & Software Connection:** How the hardware components come together to support software.  
- **Programming Challenges:** Assembling machine code, building a virtual machine, and writing a compiler.  
- **Insights and Lessons:** Reflections on key concepts and challenges faced along the way.  
- **Applications:** Hands-on projects like games and programs built with the system I create.  

## Why Follow?  
Whether you're a beginner in computer science or someone curious about how computers work, this blog breaks down the complexity into understandable pieces. Let’s explore how to build a computer, one gate and one line of code at a time!  

## Stay Connected  
Check back regularly for new posts as I progress through the course. Feedback, questions, and discussions are always welcome!
